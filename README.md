# Workbook for 1743

This repository contains the current files for the workbook I use in my 1743 class. 

The "tex" subfolder contains the .tex files associated to the workbook, and the "pretext" subfolder contains the corresponding PreTeXt code to create the web interface.

The web version and the PreTeXt files will contain solutions to the workbook, as well as commentary (when necessary) about the "overall narrative" for the notes.

There are likely errors in individual files as well as discrepancies between the .tex and .ptx versions of sections. You should be able note something in the "Issues" tab of the repository, or you can contact me. All changes will be addressed between semesters in order to guarantee consistency between versions for students.
