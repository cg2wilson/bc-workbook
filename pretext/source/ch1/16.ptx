                    <term>Simple interest</term> is the interest earned on the present value only. The rate (as a decimal) is called the <term>annual percentage rate (APR)</term> or <term>nominal rate</term>.

            We have two formulas for simple interest:

                    OU Federal Credit Union offers an APR of 6.35% (compounded monthly) for an investment opportunity, while First Fidelity offers you an APY of 5.95%.  Which option will give the highest return after one year?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The OUFCU option is best
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea here is to explicitly draw the connection that APR and APY are distinct. In future iterations, the numbers probably need to be much

                    Interest earned on the balance at any given time <m>t</m> is called <term>continuously compounding interest</term>, and has the future value formula given by
                    <me>
                        F_c(t) = Pe^{rt}\text{ dollars}
                    </me>
                    where <m>P</m> is the principal, <m>r</m> is the rate, and <m>t</m> is the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not typed out, but probably worth mentioning that <m>t</m> is still in years for this formula.

        <p>
            We also have a formula for the APY of continuously compounding interest:
            <me>
                APY_c = (e^r-1)\cdot 100\%
            </me>
