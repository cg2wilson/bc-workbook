				When giving interpretations, we have four considerations:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							When is this event happening?  Be sure to specify the interval.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							What is happening?  Specify the quantity which is changing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							How is it changing?  Specify whether or not the quantity is increasing or decreasing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							By how much is it changing?  Include proper units.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
