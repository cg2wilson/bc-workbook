        <title>Average Change vs. Instantaneous Change</title>

        <p>
            Secant lines are drawn between two points on a graph.  As the distance between the points decreases, we get values of the independent axis which are closer and closer together; we can use a limiting process to find slope of the line through a single point.  This is the called the tangent line to the point.

                <p>
                    For smooth, continuous function <m>f</m>, the <term>rate of change</term> of the function at a particular point <m>x_0</m> is given by the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m>; the rate of change of <m>f</m> at point <m>x_0</m> is denoted <m>f'(x_0)</m>

                <p>
                    The <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> of a function <m>f</m> measures slope of the graph of a function at a single point.

                    Estimate the slope of the tangent line to the curve <m>f(x) = x^2</m> at <m>x = -\dfrac{1}{2}</m> by drawing successive secant lines and computing the slope.

                    This example is meant as a time to explore and discuss; how you choose to draw this is up to you. I find it hard to draw more than two or three lines reasonably, but I do some computations and have students conjecture a slope based on a pattern (if one exists).

                    I'm on the fence about this one. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but I've found it hard to actually do well. I skipped it last semester, but might be a good enrichment-type activity, especially if you give them the formula for the function.
