			<statement>
				<p>
					Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function defined on the open interval <m>(a,b)</m>, and <m>x\in (a,b)</m>.  Then, the derivative of <m>f</m> at point <m>x</m> is given by the formula
					<me>
						\ds \lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
					</me>
					
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<question>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Why is this definition the same as the one in Section 2.4?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Answers vary
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point, I take time to draw some pictures to show what the earlier definition of the derivative "meant" and what the new one "means".
				</p>
			</solution>
		</question>

			It is useful to remember a few things from algebra when doing these calculations:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\sqrt{x + y}\neq \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>(a+b)^2 \neq a^2 + b^2</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\dfrac{a}{b+c}\neq \dfrac{a}{b} + \dfrac{a}{c}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			When we algebraically find the derivative of a function, there is a four-step process which makes the algebra much simpler, and the derivative easier to find.  The steps are:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Find and simplify <m>f(x+h)</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Find and simplify <m>f(x+h)-f(x)</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Find and simplify <m>\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Compute <m>\ds \lim_{h\to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
			This is demonstrated below.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Algebraically find the derivative of the function <m>f(x) = x^2 </m> using the four-step process. 
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<m>f(x) = 2x</m>
				</p>
				<p>
					Algebra tends not to be a strength for many students. Go deliberately and carefully; handling the notation of <m>f(x+h)</m> is a common tripping point.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Algebraically find the derivative of the function <m>f(x) = 5x -2</m> using the four-step process.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<m>f'(x) =5</m>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The time it takes an average athlete to swim 100 meters freestyle at age <m>x</m> years can be modeled as 
					<me>
						t(x) = 0.181x^2 - 8.463x + 147.376\text{ seconds}
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								Calculate the swim time at age 13 to the nearest second.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Use the algebraic method to develop a formula for the derivative of <m>t</m> (ie, find <m>t'(x)</m>).	
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								How quickly is the time to swim 100 meters freestyle changing for an average 13-year-old athlete?  Round to the nearest hundredth and interpret the result.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Compute the percent rate of change of swimmers' time at age 13, to the nearest tenth.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>t(13) = 68</m> seconds
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>t'(x) = 0.362x-8.463</m>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>t'(13) = -3.76</m> seconds per year. At age 13, the average athlete's 100m freestyle swim time is decreasing by 3.76 seconds per year
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								-5.5% per year
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Algebraically determine the derivative of <m>f(t) = \dfrac{1}{2}t^2 -\dfrac{1}{3}</m>, and evaluate <m>\dfrac{df}{dt}\bigg|_{t=1}</m>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<m>f'(1) = 1</m>
				</p>

		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Algebraically determine the derivative of <m>k(r) = r^2-2r^3</m>, and evaluate <m>k'(0)</m>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					I usually leave this one as practice, explicitly because there's a lot of algebra that they have to navigate, but I do give the answers so that they can verify their work.
				</p>
				<p>
					<m>k'(r) = 2r-6r^2</m>; <m>k'(0) = 0</m>
