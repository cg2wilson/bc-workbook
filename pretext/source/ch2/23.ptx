		<title>Notation and Terminology</title>
		
		<p>
			Rate of change at a specific point <m>a</m> is often referred to as any of the following (given a function <m>f</m>):
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						the derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						the slope of a graph of <m>f</m> at point <m>(a,f(a))</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						the slope of the line tangent to a graph of <m>f</m> at a point <m>(a,f(a))</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						the rate of change of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We also have two different notations for the derivative of <m>f</m> at point <m>a</m>:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>f'(a)</m>.  This is read ''<m>f</m> prime of <m>a</m>''
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\dfrac{df}{dx}\bigg|_{x = a}</m>.  This is read ''d-f d-x, evaluated at <m>a</m>'', or as ``the derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m>,  evaluated at <m>a</m>'
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<alert>Note</alert>: We will freely interchange between any of the above terminology or notations.

					The function <m>f</m> gives weekly profit, in thousands of dollars, that an airline makes on flights from Boston to Washington, D.C. when the ticket price is <m>p</m> dollars.  Write a sentence interpreting the following:

								When the ticket price for a flight from Boston to DC is $65, the weekly profit is increasing by 1.5 thousand dollars (profit) per dollar (ticket price)

					In parts b and c, the parenthetical descriptions aren't explicitly necessary, but might be helpful to make the unit make sense.

					The function <m>C</m> gives the number of bushels of corn produced on a tract of farmland that is treated with <m>f</m> pounds of nitrogen per acre.

					Answers vary, but I always find it helpful to talk them carefully through this problem. Their issue on "draw a graph" problems usually seems to be that their freedom in overall detail becomes a liability when synthesizing the material.

				</p>
				<p>
					The unit tends to confuse people here, and that might cause some other confusions when writing derivative-style interpretations.
				</p>

		</example>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The figure below depicts the number of customers that a fast-food restaurant serves each hour on a typical weekday:
				</p>

				<p>
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								Estimate the average rate of change of the number of customers between 7am and 11am.  Interpret your answer.

								Estimate the instantaneous rate of change and percentage rate of change of the number of customers at 4pm.  Interpret your answers.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Both of these answers depend heavily on the other point you identify lying on the line. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Students tend to be confused about how to get started, but have seemed fine after that initial push. This might be a good problem to let them try on their own, outside of class.
