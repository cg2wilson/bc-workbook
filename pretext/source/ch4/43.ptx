			<statement>
				<p>
					A function <m>f</m> has an <term>absolute maximum</term> at input <m>c</m> if <m>f(c)</m> is greater than or equal to all other outputs. Similarly, <m>f</m> has an <term>absolute minmium</term> at <m>c</m> if <m>f(c)</m> is less than or equal to all other outputs.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			In practice, there is very little distinction between what we did in 4.2 and what we do here in 4.3; the key difference is determining whether or not the particular max/min is the greatest or the least output value.

			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the function <m>f(x) = 6x^4-6x^3-5x^2+5x-1</m>
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								Locate any extreme values of the function on the interval <m>-2\leq x\leq 2</m>

						<li>
							<p>
								Classify the extreme values you found in part (a)
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					In this question (and in this section), students will confuse the procedure in Section 4.2 with the procedure in this section. Be very clear about setting the input interval/viewing window appropriately in the calculator.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm also not a fan of the phrasing "classify the extreme values" that currently exists in the workbook, since you aren't actually doing that. I would say try to make the process clear independent of my bad phrasing.

					The interval will be weird for them because they're not given a closed interval (hence you can't use the Extreme Value Theorem, like the other questions sort of expect). Remind the students that they know the shape/end behavior of the function because it's a quartic with positive leading coefficient.
				</p>
				<p>
					The window may be hard to figure, but starting with <m>[-10,10]</m> is a good starting point.

					The exam often has questions phrased like this; ensuring that they are used to the phrasing should help them when it comes to the exam. Be sure to emphasize the rounding AND the units on the answers.
