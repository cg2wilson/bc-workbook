					The percentage of people living in California in 2007 who were born in the state can be modeled as
					<me>
						P(x) = -0.0016x^3 + 0.224x^2-10.577x + 204.8\text{ percent}

				<p>
					There are several ways of identifying inflection points on a calculator. My opinion is that the easiest (for them) thing to do is to graph the derivative and identify maxes/mins on the derivative graph rather than graphing the second derivative.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whichever method you choose, I suggest showing them one and having them stick with it, in order to minimize confusion between the processes they have to learn in Chapter 4.
