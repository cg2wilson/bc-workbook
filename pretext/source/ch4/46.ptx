			<statement>
				<p>
					In 2009, airlines had a 45-inch restriction on the maximum linear measurement (length + width + height) of carry-on luggage with the height restricted to 10 inches.  Passengers concerned with keeping their travel costs down seek to maximize the capacity of their carry-on bag; what are the optimal measurements to maximize capacity?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Step 1: We want to maximize capacity of the carry-on, so we want to maximize volume.  Because volume is given by <m>V = lwh</m>, our input variables are <m>l</m>, <m>w</m>, and <m>h</m>.  In particular, we're told that <m>h = 10</m>; thus, <m>V = 10lw</m>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Step 2: Fill in the sketch below: (a box of front length <m>\ell</m>, depth <m>w</m> and height 10)
				</p>
				<p>
					Step 3: In order to write the model with a single input variable, we need a second equation to eliminate one of the variables.  We know that <m>V = 10lw</m>.  But, we are also told that the maximum linear measurement is given by <m>l + w + h = 45</m>.  Since <m>h = 10</m>, this becomes <m>l + w + 10 = 45</m>, so <m>l + w = 35</m>.  Now we can solve for either <m>l</m> or <m>w</m>.  Choose to solve for length.  Thus, <m>l = 35 - w</m>.  We can substitute this into the equation for volume:
					<md>
						<mrow>V \amp 10lw</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp 10(35-w)w </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp -10w^2+350w</mrow>
					</md>
					This gives us an equation in terms of a single variable, one which we can optimize.
				</p>
				<p>
					Step 4: In order to optimize the equation, we want to find the max or min.  Since we want the most volume, we're going to find the maximum.  We also have an interval, since <m>0 \lt l \gt 35</m> (from the maximum linear measurement).  Then,
					<me>
						V' = -20w + 350
					</me>
					Solving for <m>w</m> gives <m>w = 17.5</m>.  Plugging this in to the linear measurement, we have <m>l + 17.5 = 35</m>, so <m>l = 17.5</m>.  This means that our maximum dimensions are <m>17.5"\times17.5"\times10"</m>, and the maximized volume is <m>V = (17.5)(17.5)(10) = 3062.5</m> in<m>^3</m>.

				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Let <m>x</m> be the length of the patio (with the 4-foot opening) and <m>y</m> be the sides. Then, <m>x = 25</m> feet and <m>y = 12.5</m> feet.

					A certain orchard in Florida has found that when 14 orange trees are planted, their yield is 80 oranges per tree.  For each tree added to the orchard, each tree's yield decreases by 2 oranges per tree.  For example, if there are 15 trees planted in the orchard, the yield per tree drops to 78 oranges per tree.  Find the number of trees needed to maximize the total number of oranges produced.

					During one calendar year, a year-round elementary school cafeteria uses 42,000 styrofoam plates/packets, each containing a fork, spoon, and napkin.  The smallest amount the cafeteria can order from the supplier is one case containing 1000 plates and packets.  Each order costs $12, and the cost to store a case for the whole year is $4. Use <m>x</m> to represent the number of cases ordered at one time in the following:

					A software developer is planning the launch of a new program.  The current version of the program could be sold for $100.  Delaying the release will allow the developers to package add-ons with the program that will increase the selling price by $2 for each day of delay.  However, for each day of delay, the company will lose customers.
