<div class="para">A question students may have is why we're stopping at 32 if the input is supposed to increase without bound. I can think of two responses: 1) our rounding rules tell us to stop when the third decimal repeats twice, and this condition is met after 32; 2) students are welcome to try more numbers to play around with the behavior, but should know that if this were a test question, they would need to stop after 32.</div>
