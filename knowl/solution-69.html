<div class="para">Technically, a logarithmic model isn't best here either (because there is an asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(y=100\)</span>). However, since students haven't learned logistic models at this point in the class, a logarithmic is the best that we have. It could be useful to come back and analyze this question more during/after Section 1.10.</div>
