<div class="para">A software developer is planning the launch of a new program.  The current version of the program could be sold for $100.  Delaying the release will allow the developers to package add-ons with the program that will increase the selling price by $2 for each day of delay.  However, for each day of delay, the company will lose customers.  The company could sell 400,000 copies now, but for each day that release is delayed, they will sell 2,300 fewer copies of the software.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
