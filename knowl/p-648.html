<div class="para">A travel agency offers spring break cruise packages.  The agency advertises a cruise to Cancun for $1200 per person.  To promote the cruise among student organizations on campus, the agency offers a discount for student groups selling the cruise to over 50 of their members.  The price per student will be discounted by $10 for each student in excess of 50 (for example, if an organization had 55 members go on the cruise, each of those students would pay $1150).  Write a model for the travel agency's revenue that depends on the number of students from a student organization.</div>
