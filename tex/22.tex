\section*{Measures of Change at a Point - Graphical}\label{cs22}
	\subsection*{Tangent Lines and Secant Lines}
		\begin{defn}[Secant Line]
			Let $f$ be continuous and smooth function on the some input interval $[a,b]$.  Let $x_1 < x_2$ be two points in $[a,b]$.  The \textbf{secant line} through $x_1$ and $x_2$ is the line whose slope is \showto{ins}{\fbox{$\dfrac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$}}\showto{st}{\\$ $ \\}
		\end{defn}
			
		The characteristic of a secant line is that it ``intentionally'' goes through $f$ in two points.  
		
		\begin{question}
			The formula for the slope of a secant line should look familiar; what's the other name we used for this?
		\end{question}
			\vs{.5}
			
		\begin{ex}
			Let $f(x) = x^2$.  Find the secant line through $x_1 = -\dfrac{1}{2}$ and $x_2 = 2$, then sketch $f(x)$ and the secant line.  
		\end{ex}
			\vs{3}
			
	\subsection*{Average Change vs. Instantaneous Change}
		Secant lines are drawn between two points on a graph.  As the distance between the points decreases, we get values of the independent axis which are closer and closer together; we can use a limiting process to find slope of the line through \emph{a single point}.  This is the called the \emph{tangent} line to the point.
			\vspace{.1in}
			
		\begin{defn}[Rate of Change]
			For smooth, continuous function $f$, the \textbf{rate of change} of the function at a particular point \showto{st}{\\[15pt]} $x_0$ is given by \showto{ins}{\fbox{the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$}}\showto{st}{\blank{2.5}}; the rate of change of $f$ at point $x_0$ is \showto{st}{\\[15pt]} denoted \showto{ins}{\fbox{$f'(x_0)$}}\showto{st}{\blank{1.5}}.
		\end{defn}
			\newpage
			
		\begin{defn}[Instantaneous ROC] 
			The \textbf{instantaneous rate of change} of a function $f$ measures \showto{ins}{\fbox{slope of the graph}\\ \fbox{of a function at a single point}}\showto{st}{\blank{2}\\[15pt] \blank{3}}.
		\end{defn}
			\vspace{.1in}
			
		\begin{ex}
			Estimate the slope of the tangent line to the curve $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = -\dfrac{1}{2}$ by drawing successive secant lines and computing the slope.
		\end{ex}
			\vs{2}
			
		\begin{ex}
			For the curve below, use successive secant lines to estimate $f'(0.4)$.

		\begin{defn}[Percentage Rate of Change]
			For smooth, continuous function $f$, if the rate of change $f'(x_0)$ exists for input value $x_0$ and $f(x_0)\neq 0$, then we define the \textbf{percentage rate of change} as \showto{ins}{$\dfrac{f'(x_0)}{f(x_0)}$\\ }\showto{st}{\\[15pt] $ $ \\[15pt] $ $ \\[15pt]}
		The output for percentage rate of change is \showto{ins}{\fbox{\% per unit input}}\showto{st}{\blank{3}}.

			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item If the band had 3000 listeners four months after the release of their first album, and the percent rate of change was 36\% per month, find the rate of change of listeners in the fourth month to the nearest whole number.  Give a sentence of interpretation for your answer.

Find the average rate of change of the band's Spotify listeners between four months and a year after the release of the first album.  Round to the nearest whole number, if necessary.
